# Fitbit Dataset Analysis

This project involves working with a Fitbit dataset to perform basic data analysis and regression modeling.

---

## Contents

- Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Implementation of:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
  - XGBRegressor

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

---

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for nulls, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

2. **EDA**  
   - Visualized distributions and correlations between features.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created additional features to assist model learning.

4. **Modeling**  
   - Trained and tested Linear Regression, RFR, and XGBRegressor models.
   - Evaluated using standard regression metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE, RÂ²).

## Notes

- Dataset used: Fitbit activity data.
- All experiments were done in Jupyter Notebook.
- No hyperparameter tuning was applied unless otherwise stated in the code.
